**WHAT IS BIBTIA?**

It is the research platform of the Bibtia project, which was launched in 2023. Since the day it was founded, it has been moving towards being the largest resource site on the internet. Bibtia is an open-source, free, non-profit encyclopedia whose content is co-created by volunteers from all over the world. This site uses Ceşa technology, that is, anyone with a computer connected to the internet in the world can add, remove, edit on all pages.
